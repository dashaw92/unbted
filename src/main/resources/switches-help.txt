Usage: unbted [options] [file]

Una's NBT Editor

Edit an NBT (Named Binary Tag) file interactively, or print it out in a
JSON-like format for reading. Optionally convert it to well-formed JSON
for processing.

Valid options:
	-?, -h, --help
		Print this help.

	-c<method>, --compression=<method>
		Assume the given compression method, rather than autodetecting.
		Valid methods are None, Deflate, and GZip. (case-insensitive)

	-d, -v, --debug, --verbose
		Print more information and stacktraces.

	-x, --extended
		Enable OpenNBT extensions.
			(incompatible with -o)

	-o, --old
		Disable newer additions to the NBT format, such as int arrays.
			(incompatible with -e)

	-p, --print
		Exit after printing file contents.
			(incompatible with -n)

	-n, --no-print
		Don't print out initial file contents, just edit.
			(incompatible with -p)

	--endian=<endianness>, --big-endian, --little-endian
		Assume the input is the given endianness, instead of attempting
		to detect it. Historically, Pocket Edition had little-endian
		NBT files as part of its save format, but this was replaced
		with a custom LevelDB format in 0.9.0.
		Tip: If you're attempting to read one of these files, they
		contain extra metadata at the start of the file. I wasn't able
		to obtain an example file to test with, so I did not add
		support for stripping these headers. You may attempt to strip
		them manually using dd - the entities.dat is supposed to have
		12 bytes of junk, and the level.dat is supposed to have 8.
		e.g. dd if=entities.dat of=entities.lnbt skip=12 iflag=skip_bytes
		Valid endiannesses are Big and Little. (case-insensitive)

	-s, -j, --strict, --json
		Print out well-formed JSON instead of a human-readable
		colored format.
			(implies -f and -6)

	-6, --base64
		Print byte arrays as Base64 instead of hex.
			(incompatible with -d)

	-d, --decimal
		Print byte arrays as decimal instead of hex.
			(incompatible with -6)

	-f, --full
		Don't truncate byte arrays in summaries.

	-r, --raw
		Don't infer types.

	--no-pager
		Disable use of the embedded less-like pager.

Exit codes:
	0: Success
	1: Failed to parse command line
	2: Failed to load file
	3: Unexpected internal error
