Una's NBT Editor

Type names prefixed with a ~ indicate inferred types, such as JSON
strings or UUID long pairs. Type names prefixed with a ! indicate
nonstandard OpenNBT extensions.

Arguments in <angle brackets> represent required arguments.
[Square brackets] indicate optional arguments. Arguments followed by
"..." indicate the argument may be repeated.

A yellow * will be displayed before the prompt if the file has been
modified.

cd
	Arguments: <path>
	Change the command context to the given named compound child of the
	current compound, similar to a change-directory command in a
	filesystem. Multiple levels can be traversed by separating compound
	names with a forward slash. With no arguments, jumps to the root of
	the file.

ls, dir
	Arguments: [path]
	Print out the contents of the current command context, or a child
	specified by a path like one that would be given to cd. By default,
	only prints immediate children.
	Switches:
	-R, --recursive
		Print all descendants recursively, instead of only immediate
		children.
	-d, --directory
		Print the compound itself, rather than its children.
		Overshadows -R.
	-r, --raw
		Don't infer types.
	-l, --long
		Print values.
	-1, -a, -A
		Ignored. Recognized to avoid mistakes from habit.

rm, del, rmdir, rd
	Arguments: <path>...
	Delete the given tag(s). If a tag is a compound and is not empty,
	print an error and do nothing.
	Switches:
	-r, --recursive
		Also delete nonempty compounds.
	-f, --force
		Ignore errors and attempt to remove every item listed.

exit, abort
	No arguments.
	Exit unbted, without saving changes. You will be asked to confirm
	if there are unsaved changes.
	Switches:
	-f, --force
		Don't ask to confirm when there are unsaved changes. Implied if
		the command is invoked as abort.

save
	Arguments: [file]
	Save changes to the given file, or the file that was originally
	loaded. If a file was not loaded, the file argument is required.
	This is true when loading from stdin or when creating a new empty
	file.
	Switches:
		-c=<method>, --compression=<method>
			Override the compression method used. Valid values are None,
			Deflate, and GZip. GZip is the most common. Required on new
			empty files. Otherwise, defaults to the compression that
			was used when the file was loaded.
		--endian=<endianness>, --little-endian, --big-endian
			Write a <endianness>-endian file instead of the default.
			See the program help for more information about why unbted
			supports little-endian NBT.
			Valid endiannesses are Big and Little. (case-insensitive)
		-d, --default
			Update the default file, compression method, and endianness
			to those specified.

info
	No arguments.
	Print information about the loaded file, such as its
	compression algorithm, root tag name, total size, etc.
	-s, --si
		Use SI units (1000) instead of binary units (1024)

echo
	Arguments: [anything]...
	Print arguments.
	Switches:
	-e
		Parse escapes. The following escapes are recognized:
			\\ backslash
			\a alert (BEL)
			\b backspace
			\c produce no further output
			\e escape
			\f form feed
			\n new line
			\r carriage return
			\t horizontal tab
			\v vertical tab
			\0NNN byte with octal value NNN (1 to 3 digits)
			\xHH byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)
			\uHHHH UTF-16 character with hexadecimal value HHHH (1 to 4
				digits)
			\UHHHHHHHH UCS-4 character with hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH
				(1 to 8 digits)
	-s
		Do not separate arguments with spaces.
	-n
		Do not emit a newline.

rem, remark, comment, #, //
	Arguments: [anything]...
	Do nothing, ignore all arguments.
