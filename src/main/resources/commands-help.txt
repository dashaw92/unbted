cd
	Change the command context to the given named compound child of the
	current compound, similar to a change-directory command in a
	filesystem. Multiple levels can be traversed by separating compound
	names with a forward slash. With no arguments, jumps to the root of
	the file.

dir, ls
	Print out the contents of the current command context, or a child
	specified by a path like one that would be given to cd. By default,
	only prints immediate children.
	Switches:
	-R, --recursive
		Print all descendants recursively, instead of only immediate
		children.
	-d, --directory
		Print the compound itself, rather than its children.
		Overshadows -R.
	-r, --raw
		Don't infer types
	-l, -1, -a, -A
		Ignored. Support may be added in the future. Ignored in the
		mean time to prevent muscle memory mistakes.
